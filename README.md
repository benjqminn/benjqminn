I am a current Computer Science student at UNC Charlotte, concentrating in Cybersecurity. I have a profound interest in technology, and a dedication to making the internet more secure. I’m particularly drawn to cybersecurity because it allows me to combine technical problem-solving with meaningful impact. 

## Objective

My journey in computer science has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst. I’ve always found it fascinating to be able to protect people online, and I’m driven by the goal of making a meaningful impact in the cybersecurity space.
