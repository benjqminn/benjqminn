**Cloud & Security Engineer in Training** • **Early Entry M.S. Cybersecurity @ UNC Charlotte**
**B.S. Computer Science (Cybersecurity) + Minor in Mathematics**

I’m a cloud-focused security builder working at the intersection of **cloud architecture, threat detection, and defensive engineering**. My work blends scalable infrastructure design with hands-on SOC simulation and real-world attack analysis.

I build systems that are **secure by design, observable by default, and resilient under pressure**.

---

## 🚀 What I’m Focused On (Feb 2026)

* Designing secure AWS architectures across **EC2, IAM, VPC, CloudWatch, CloudTrail, Lambda, and CloudFront**
* Strengthening multi-cloud foundations with **Azure (AZ-900)** and security tooling exposure
* Advancing toward **AWS Certified Security – Specialty (SCS-C03)**
* Expanding cloud-native detection and monitoring workflows within Obscura

---

## 🎯 Objective

I’m targeting roles in:

* **Cloud Security Engineering**
* **Security Engineering (Cloud / Infrastructure)**
* **SOC & Detection Engineering (Cloud-first environments)**

My long-term goal is to design and secure enterprise-scale cloud environments that integrate architecture, automation, and detection into one cohesive security strategy.
