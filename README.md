# Hello, I'm Benjamin Taylor
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/btayl106/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-0072b1?&style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white" /></a>

I'm a Computer Science student at UNC Charlotte, concentrating in **Cybersecurity** with a minor in **Mathematics**. I specialize in threat detection, network forensics, and SOC operations, combining deep technical skills with a mission-driven mindset.

My work blends applied security engineering with real-world problem solving. Whether it be building live PCAP analysis platforms or publishing research on IoT vulnerabilities, I’m driven by the goal of making systems safer, smarter, and more resilient.


## Objective

My journey in computer science led me to develop a deep passion for Cybersecurity. I’m now focused on transitioning into a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst, where I can actively monitor threats, triage alerts, and defend critical systems. I’ve always been driven by the idea of protecting others in the digital space. I’m committed to making a real, measurable impact in the field.
